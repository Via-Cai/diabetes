Finding and avoiding diabetes in the earlier stages can help reduce the risk of serious health issues such as circulatory system diseases, kidney malfunction, and vision loss. This competition involves developing a predictive model for effectively detecting potential Diabetes cases, ideally, before commencing preventive treatment.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e8d41968","metadata":{},"source":["## ðŸ”Ž Key Findings\n","- The dataset contains"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2f5929b9-9d9a-457a-99ab-be05f27176f9","metadata":{},"source":["## ðŸ’¾ The data\n","\n","The dataset contains diagnostic measurements that are associated with diabetes, which were collected from a population of Pima Indian women.
