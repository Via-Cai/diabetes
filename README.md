## ðŸ“– Background
Diabetes mellitus remains a global health issue, causing several thousand people to die each day from this single condition. Finding and avoiding diabetes in the earlier stages can help reduce the risk of serious health issues such as circulatory system diseases, kidney malfunction, and vision loss. This competition involves developing a predictive model for effectively detecting potential Diabetes cases, ideally, before commencing preventive treatment.

## ðŸ’¾ The data

The dataset contains diagnostic measurements that are associated with diabetes, which were collected from a population of Pima Indian women. The data includes various medical and demographic attributes, making it a well-rounded resource for predictive modeling.

The columns and Data Types are as follows:


| Column Name                  | Data Type   | Description |
| :----------------            | :------     | :---- |
| Pregnancies                  | Numerical   | Number of times the patient has been pregnant. |
| Glucose                      | Numerical   | Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test. |
| BloodPressure                | Numerical   | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). |
| SkinThickness                | Numerical   | Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).  |
| Insulin                      | Numerical   | 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml). |
| BMI                          | Numerical   | Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).. |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction     | Numerical   | A function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history. |
| SkinThickness                | Numerical   | Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).  |
| Age                          | Numerical   | Age of the patient in years. |
| Outcome           | Binary (Categorical)   | Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient is diagnosed with diabetes. 1 = Yes, 0 = No.  |
